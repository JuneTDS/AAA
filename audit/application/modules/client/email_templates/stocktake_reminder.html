<p>Dear Sir or Madam:</p>

<p><b>RE: OBSERVATION OF STOCK COUNT</b></p>

<p>We noted that your company will soon be closing the accounts for the financial year/period ended {fye_date}.</p>

<p>Please be informed that observing the year end physical inventory count is a compulsory audit procedure required by the Singapore Standard on Auditing (“the Standard”) for companies with a material stock balance. The Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS) in its circular has also stipulated that stock-take be performed at the close of each accounting period to determine the closing stock value.</p>

<p>In view of the significance of this matter, we advise that if your company holds stock, then the necessary procedures to prepare and conduct a physical stock count be carried out to comply with the Standard and the IRAS’ recommended practice. In addition, should the value of your stock form a material portion of your total assets, you will be required to notify us to observe this count. </p>

<p>Please do not hesitate to contact us should you require any further clarification.</p>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>Yours faithfully,
<br/>
